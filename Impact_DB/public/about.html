<h1 style="color:#f35b71;">ABOUT IMPACT</h1>
<p>ImpACT is a project created by two university students, Aniesha Sangarapillai and Zahra Ahmadi. The project is a visualization of the flow of emotions of social media users as they come across various situations online. </p>
<p>“Imp” stands for impression and “ACT” stands for action/reaction. The goal of ImpACT is to make its users become conscious of how they act, react and behave towards social media situations. ImpACT will enable the user to reflect upon their relationship with social media and other users of social media. It makes the user understand that the emotions and reactions that we are putting into social media leaves an impression on its environment as well as the users. The situations one faces on social media leaves an impression on the user’s life in how one looks at their personal life. </p>
<p>As each user begins to become conscious of themselves as a social media user, social media will become more reliable and sound as an environment. ImpACT will encourage users to have more healthier relationships between the users and more understanding towards each other.</p>
