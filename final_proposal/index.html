<p><strong>ImpACT</strong> is a data visualization website which will consist of 10 situations that will need to be answered by the user. The user will respond to these situations based on their <strong>emotional reaction</strong> to the particular situation. These responses will have several variations because the answer depends on the user's behaviorial habits and point of view towards the situation. </p>
<p>The situations that will be given to the user will be spefically related to their <strong>reactions to situations that take place on social media</strong>. These situations are personal and closely tied with the user.
<p>The format of response will be multiple choice between 6 options. Each response from the user will express a certain emotion. As the user delivers their response, the data will collect the emotion that is being expressed in each response. At the end of the questionnaire, the data will be analyzed to find out which emotion is the most dominant out of the 10 responses. For example, out of the 10 responses, the user might have responded angrily to 7 of the situations. In the end, the user will be informed about their <strong>most dominant emotional reaction</strong>. </p>
<p>As the users come and go from this website, the background visuals of the website will be dynamic. <strong>The results of the users emotions is what determines and changes the environment of the space.</strong> The more positive responses, the more pleasing the website environment will be. </p>

<h2 id="significance">SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</h2>
<p><strong>ImpACT</strong> considers two important keywords: <strong>"emotion" and "reaction"</strong>. As human beings, these keywords hold immense importance to all of us because we all have emotions and we all react. This is the basic nature of every being. Our emotions and reactions to situations are what shapes our outlook of life. Today, we can say that we have two lives. One online and one offline and they both definitely have an effect on each other. Ever since the Internet, specifically, social media, has become a platform of sharing one's life, <strong> it is important for every user to become conscious of one's emotions, reactions and online behavior.</strong>  These emotions and reactions can have positive effects as well as negative effects. The same social media platform that brings enjoyment to one, is the same one that causes one to become depressed leading to severe consequences to one's life. It all depends on how one feels, reacts and behaves to the siuations they face on social media. It is really important for the user to realize that they have an effect on social media through their social interactions and that the responses they recieve has an effect on them too.
  <strong> ImpACT can be seen as a visual representation of a miniature social media network</strong>  where the users will be able the see cycles of emotions that are floating through this network we have created. The overall experience of this space will help develop multiple layers of understanding for the user.
</p>
<p><strong> ImpACT</strong> will make the user reflect upon their <strong> relationship with social media and other users of social media.</strong>  This explorable network space will make the user understand that the emotions and reactions that we are putting into social media has its effects on its environment as well as the users. The emotions and reactions that we take from social media has its effects on one's mental health and personal life. By seeing the visual effects that are based on the users reactions (which determine the condition of the website), the user will be able to reflect on a larger scale and think about the condition of the entire social media network as a whole. <strong> ImpACT</strong>  will enable the user to develop an awareness, that, just like how we have a social responsibiity in society, we also have a <strong> social responsibilty online </strong> as well. It will encourage the user understand that the
<strong> condition of social media depends on its users </strong> . Social media can be a healthy space, but it can also be a dangerous place to be part of and as a user, one must become conscious of this. The more conscious one becomes on how they respond  and behave to social media situations, the more pleasent and safe environment social media will be. One cannot change how others express, react and behave, but one can definitely begin the change by becoming more conscious about how they express, react and behave. This project can also be seen as an effort to try and bring awareness to important issues such as <strong> cyber-bullying<strong>  and </strong> mental health</strong> . As each user begins to become conscious of themselves as a social media user, social media will become more reliable and sound as an environment. <strong> ImpACT</strong>  will encourage users to have more healthier relationships between the users and more understanding towards each other.
</p>
<p>
By enabling the user to understand themselves as a social media user, it will challenge them to <strong> improve their social media behavior </strong>. By going through the process of responding to the situations, the user will get the oppurtunity to take time to think and reflect about their reactions. By recieving an overall report of which emotion seems to be the most dominant reaction they express online, the user will be able to understand if they possess positive or negative online behavior. The user will be able to understand how much impact they have on social media, on other users and how much impact social media has on them. The visual effects of the website dynamically changing based on the responses of the user will enable the user to become more aware of their social media interactions and social media enviroment. Social media has become an important part of our lives. It is important to take care of this environment because this environment has its consequences if it's not taken care of with consciousness. Overall,
<strong> ImpACT will be informative and eye-opening </strong> for every visitor and hopefully establish healthier online behavior and environment.

<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
<p class="bold">We have researched three similar projects that relate to ImpACT's concept and ideas. <a href="http://atlasofemotions.org" alt="Atlas of Emotions website" target="_blank"/>Atlas of Emotions</a>, <a href="https://www.fuseworks.it/en/works/amygdala/" alt="amygdala website" target="_blank"/>Amygdala</a> and <a href="https://chekhov.withgoogle.com/alive?" target="_blank" alt="checkhov website"/>Chekhov</a>. Please see below,
  for project descriptions and comparisons. </p>
<br />
<h2>ATLAS OF EMOTIONS</h2>
<img src="imgs/atlas.jpg" alt="Atlas of Emotions"/>
<p>
<strong> Atlas of emotions is an interactive website which tries to show the user how different emotional responses to a same trigger can result in creation of various reactions.</strong>
The goal of this website is to make the user capable of getting more control over what triggers their emotions, by making them aware of various emotion definitions and how the intensity of those emotions can lead to occurrence of different reactions.
Atlas of emotions analyzes the user's emotional response, the intensity of it and the variety of reactions through subsequent pages which are: the timeline, the experience and the response.
</p>
<p>
In the Timeline webpage, the user starts the process. On the left side of the page there is a canvas which guides the user on the directions. At the middle of the page is the trigger question (ex: a friend gets angry with you...). Then, on the bottom, five emotions are located to be chosen as the answer to the situation: Anger, Fear, Disgust, Sadness and Enjoyment. Once the user chooses an open, the user will be given a reason as to why you must be feeling such way. For example, if the user chooses fear as the response to the situation, "your friend is angry with you", the screen will display, "you imagine them leaving".
</p>
<p>
The Experience page will give the user a more visual representation. The page displays different emotions that can be clicked on and explored. Once the user clicks on an emotion, they will be redirected to a graph that represents the mildest to the most extreme of any emotion. Each level of intensity has a brief definition to provide the user with some more information about that particular level.
</p>
<p>
The Response page is the last part of the analysis. The user, by selecting each level of the graphic can find out how the reactions to the same trigger can be different based on the intensity of their feelings.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the Atlas of Emotions is greatly helping the users develop a more comprehensive understanding of their emotions and reactions that make up their personality.
</p>

<h3>How is ImpACT different from Atlas of Emotions?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Atlas of Emotions</strong> is a great educational website. It has everything and anything that you need to know about emotions and reactions. A great website to refer to. The <strong>Atlas of Emotions</strong> and <strong>ImpACT</strong> both focus on emotions and reactions. The <strong>Atlas of Emotions</strong> focuses more on emotions and reactions in a more general context and goes in depth to define and analyze each emotion and reaction. While <strong>ImpACT</strong> focuses on our emotional reactions and bahavior in the context of social media which makes it more interesting and helps the user to connect more on a personal level. The <strong>Atlas of Emotions</strong> is showing us how different emotions have different results while in <strong>ImpACT</strong>, the results are more visible because the condition of the website itself is representing the results of the emotions of the users who have visited the website. The website is dynamically changing in order to better represent the impact of these emotions. </p>

<h2>AMYGDALA</h2>
<img src="imgs/amygdala.jpg" alt="amygdala"/><p>
<strong>Amygdala is a generative data installation</strong> created by Fuse*, a studio & production company based in Italy. They go by the philosophy that, by determining the collective emotional state of the users, we will be able to determine the emotional state of the Internet. The installation uses tweets and an algorithm of <strong>sentimental analysis</strong> to analyze and represent the overall dominant emotional state of Twitter users in order to showcase the overall emotional state of the Internet. The installation will prompt interpretations & cause the audience to reflect about the consequences of the digital revolution. The installation is an audio visual representation of users reactions to events that take place around the world. <strong>Amygdala </strong>goes through several steps to achieve this installation. Firstly, the Twitter feeds are analyzed at a rate of 30 tweets/second by a sentimental analysis open source libarary called Synesketch. The tweets are analysed word by word and is given 6 values to represent the percentage of the 6 emotions. In the end, Syneketch determines what is the strongest emotion expressed in each tweet and calculates the percentages. The process of the analysis is represented at their Media Garden through audio and lights. The representation of the data in the installation itself is quite abstract. Then, the overall gathered data is displayed as Amygdala cycles at Mediateca where the information is represented in a more clear manner. Each emotion is assigned a specific color and the percentages that are given for each emotion form a circle (an Amygdala cycle). Each Amygdala cycle is different because the incoming data is always different. A new cycle is created every 10 minutes in the Videowall as it receives the information from the Media Garden. The visitor will see a new set of pattern each time and hear a different sound as one cycle changes to another. All the emotions data that is gathered from the installation is finally archived.
<strong>Amygdala</strong> has analyzed millions of tweets in a period of 3 months, running 24hrs a day. It is a really beautiful and interesting installation.
</p><h3>How is ImpACT different from Amygdala?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amygdala</strong> and <strong>ImpACT</strong> have similar ideas in terms of focus and analyzation to execute the project. <strong>Both projects have the intention of shining light on the changes and effects that take place in a networked space based on the emotions and reactions of the online users.</strong> What makes <strong>ImpACT</strong> better than <strong>Amygdala</strong> is the accessibility and participation. The <strong>Amygdala</strong> installation was created in 2016 and it was a project that took place for only three months. Only the people who visited Bologna, Italy, were able to see and experience the installation. What remains now, is just an archive of emotions. It is less accessible. <strong>ImpACT</strong>, however, is a project that will be created as a webpage which means that anyone from anywhere at any given time can access it. In <strong>Amygdala</strong>, the spectators were able to see the changes that take place in the installation based off of the tweets of Twitter users. They are seing the impact of other users. The only sort of participation that takes place in Amygdala as a spectator is for the spectator to be present at the installation and look around.
In <strong>InpACT</strong>, there is a closer relationship between the user and the space because it requires the user to fully participate and in result, they are able to see their own effect being applied to the web space. They are able to witness the changes they have made the to space and this enables them to connect more to the piece. Both projects will trigger a reflection for the user/spectator but ImpACT will trigger a reflection in a more personal level and enable the user to develop a consciousness as a social media user and their situation handling skills as an individual.

<h2>CHEKHOV</h2>
<img src="imgs/checkhov.jpg" alt="checkhov"/>
<p>
<strong>Chekhov is a project that has been created in collaboration with Google and MXT in hopes of promoting famous Russian writer named Anton Chekhov's works and plays all over the world. </strong>Their aim was to enable a 24 hours online theatrical performance. The first step into making this happen was to establish an online audition. The users of the website took part to answer a questionnaire in which the user is required to respond to seven different situations. The seven given situations are multiple choice questions which ask the user to choose one the four prepared answers. At the end of the questionnaire, they are given one of the 42 characters of Anton Chekhov that best matches their answers to the personality of that particular character. The user will then be able to audition for this character with a given script and send their audition video to the makers of the Chekhov Is Alive project and take part in the casting. The first online reading of Checkhov's theatrical work took place on September 25th, 2015 and achieve major success. Millions of people took part in the casting and recieved online recognition.
</p>
<h3>How is ImpACT different from Chekhov?</h3>
<p>
Using a simple questionnaire, <strong>Chekhov</strong> and <strong>ImpAct</strong> are both designed to give the user the opportunity to explore their personality in an online space and also find out how different characters, the users of internet can possess, just by giving various responses to a certain set of questions. However, <strong>ImpAct</strong>'s advantages to the user outweighs the advantages of <strong>Chekhov</strong>. <strong>ImpACT enables social media users to participate in the project whereas Chekhov is more designed for those who are interested in acting and theatrical performances.</strong> The character results that the user gets from the <strong>Chekhov</strong> project enables them to connect with a character from Anton Chekhov's works but does not really bring any advantage to the user into taking a step to improve themselves or becoming aware of their social environment. Moreover, <strong>ImpAct</strong> allows the users to know what kind of feelings flow in an online space, how much impact postive and negative it can have on them and the environment of the space itself. There is a more personal connection for the user. Finally, Chekhov is more an amusing website that users who are interested in Chekhov works and characters may be willing to experience it, whereas the ImpAct is kind of a sentimental analysis of internet users that later can be used as a resource for further studies on how the social media environment and the users's emotional state and reactions corelate.
<strong>Chekhov</strong> is a great project which enables users from around the world who are passionate about acting to join together to recreate Chekhov's piece to keep him alive while <strong>ImpACT</strong> is a project that aims to create healthier relationships between online users.
